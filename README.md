This project gets its name from the container I used to house it.  Looking through my
junk pile, I found a box perfectly suited for this project.  I don't know where it 
came from our how it made it into the pile.  It had the word Dakota embossed in the 
steel, so there you go.

This project fonts from **Google Fonts** at https://fonts.google.com  This is a repository of open source fonts.  These have 
been turned into bitmap fonts using the **FontForge** app. See https://fontforge.org/en-US/

The libraries in the **lib** folder are open source from Adafruit and I'm not sure on the propriety 
of checking them in here, versus pointing to the somehow.  If I've offended, I'm sorry, but
putting them here is the only way to make a downloadable project bundle.
